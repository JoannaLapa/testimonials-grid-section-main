## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- gulp

### What I learned

By this project I practised CSS Grid and SASS component structure 

### Continued development

My main aim for next month is practising SASS and JS. When I will decide that my skills on both of them are enough good I would like to learn Vue.js, Wordpress and PHP basics

### Useful resources

- [SASS Guidline](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) - This helped me for SASS component structure reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [SASS Boilerplate](https://github.com/KittyGiraudel/sass-boilerplate) - With this example I organised my SASS component structure.
- [SASS Documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/) - and [Kevin Powell's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR-a8upNjJ0) helped me with replacing @import with @use and @forward in my SASS component structure.
- [MMC School CSS Grid course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tqu3ssntMa4&list=PLxv_3XVN6Gc2Ki7m4H4vJAnDpnwysjD7C) - with this course I learnt about Grid basics.
- [A complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) and [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout#guides) - those 2 guides are perfect for learning CSS Grid.
